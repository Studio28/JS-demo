### Phase 1

Create a story-telling program:

1. Use the prompt() command several times to collect different types of words -- nouns, verbs, adjectives.
2. Store the result of each prompt() command in a different variable.
3. Combine the variables with other strings to create one or more non-sensical statements.
4. Print the resulting story to the browser using the document.write() command.

- [ ] Create a variable and capture input prompt("ask a question.")
- [ ] Create separate variable for each piece of input
- [ ] Add an alert to tell the visitor they're finished (alert "you're done!)
- [ ] Combine the input with other strings to create a message "you said: " + response
- [ ] Print the story to the document window document.write()
